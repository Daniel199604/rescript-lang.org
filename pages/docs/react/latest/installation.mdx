# Installation

Add following dependency to your ReScript project (in case you don't have any project yet, check out the [installation instructions](/docs/manual/latest/installation) in the manual):

```
npm install reason-react --save
```

Then add the following setting to your existing `bsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "reason": { "react-jsx": 3 },
  "bs-dependencies": ["reason-react"]
}
```

To test your setup, create a new `.res` file in your source directory and add the following code:

```res
// src/Test.res
@react.component
let make = () => {
  <div> {React.string("Hello World")} </div>
}
```

Now rerun your build with `bsb -make-world` and you should see a successful build.

## Exposed Modules 

After a successful installation, ReasonReact will make following modules available in your project's global scope:

- `React`: Bindings to React
- `ReactDOM`: Bindings to the ReactDOM
- `ReactDOMServer`: Bindings to the ReactDOMServer
- `ReactEvent`: Bindings to React's synthetic events
- `ReactDOMStyle`: Bindings to the inline style API
- `ReasonReactRouter`: A simple, yet fully featured router with minimal memory allocations


### Deprecated Modules

ReasonReact has gone a long way, so we still keep around a few modules for legacy reasons. We will deprecate them in the future in favor of...

- `ReasonReact` -> `React`
- `ReactDOMRe` -> `ReactDOM`
- `ReactDOMServerRe` -> `ReactDOMServer`
- `ReasonReactCompat` -> no replacement needed

Actual usage and for each module will be discussed in the rest of this documentation.
